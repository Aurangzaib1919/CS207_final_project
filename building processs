Building process:

The basic component is arduino nano where the code goes has to be connected to the sound sensor 5 volts
and then the addressable leds has to be connected to the sound sensor for that either we can them with female to male header pins
to connect to the sound sensor.and the sound sensor sense the sound and plays the leds and the leds colours changes as well based
on the sound input.
