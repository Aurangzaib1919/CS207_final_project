INRODUCTION:

The main idea is to make the leds dance on the source of sound and we are using a sound sensor to do that.

The project has three parts.
1)Arduino nano
2)sound sensor microphone with 5V
3)Addressable leds
Or 
Led lettuce

So the Arduino Nano where the code goes.
The sound sensor is which hears the sound and gives the signal to the leds so that the leds can dance on the sound.
