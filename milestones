Milestones:

First milestone is making of your code work with the the components and it is bit hard because we need the 5 
volt to work and have to set it once it works then you are good to go.


The second milestone to be achieved is the synchronization of led with the the sound because
it goes off the beats as well.so it has to be corrected.

The third of the milestone that the sound works perfectly with the colour changing scheme 
otherwise it will play same thing over and over again on the same over the different source of music.
