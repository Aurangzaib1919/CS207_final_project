On the off chance that utilizing the LED lattice or we can use a strip of led the code is for led strip 
out of the blue or we can put the led strip, we unequivocally suggest working through that full instructional 
exercise first. This will give you a chance to test and affirm that the Matrix is legitimately collected before 
proceeding onward to this further developed undertaking.
In the event that working with a breadboard as we appear beneath,
bind push headers on to the amplifier breakout and LED network knapsack sheets (three sticks on the previous, four on the last mentioned). 
You can alternatively utilize 90 degree headers on the off chance that you'd like either segment to be situated holding up.
On account of the "smarts" of the LED framework rucksack, this entire task requires less than twelve associations add up to:

Interface the Arduino's 3.3V stick both to the mic amp VCC stick and the Arduino's AREF stick. 
We utilize one of the power rails on the breadboard to course 3.3 Volts to the two areas.
The AREF association is imperative — don't neglect this!

Interface the Arduino 5V stick to the LED lattice + stick.

Interface Arduino GND stick to both the mic amp GND stick and the LED network – stick. 
You can utilize a breadboard control rail, or the Arduino has various GND pins accessible.

Interface Arduino simple stick 0 to the mic amp OUT stick.

Interface Arduino pins SDA and SCL to the lattice rucksack D (information) and C (clock) pins, individually.
Prior Arduino sheets do exclude SDA and SCL pins — rather, utilize simple pins 4 and 5.

For a current "R3" Arduino board, (for example, the Arduino Leonardo or later Arduino Uno and Mega sheets),
the wiring ought to look like this:
